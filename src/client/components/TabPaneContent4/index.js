        There is usually a one-week, unpaid waiting period between when you
        first apply and when you may collect benefits. This week has been waived
        for eligible COVID-19 claims.

      <h4>1. We will issue you an EDD Debit Card</h4>

      <p>
        Benefit payments for Unemployment Insurance, Pandemic Unemployment
        Assistance (PUA), Disability Insurance, and Paid Family Leave are all
        made using the EDD Visa Debit Card.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically, it will take about a week after you certify before you
        receive your first benefit payment. If you applied for PUA, your EDD
        Debit Card will be issued within 24-48 hours after you submit your
        application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the high volume of claims, it may take a few extra days to
        receive your EDD Debit Card in the mail.

      <h5>About your EDD Debit Card</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you were issued an EDD Debit Card in the last three years, you will
          receive your benefit payments on that card. If your card has expired,
          a new card will automatically be sent to you once funds are available.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you lost your EDD Debit Card, contact Bank of America at
          1-866-692-9374 (TTY: 1-866-692-9374). It may be difficult to reach a
          representative by phone due to high call volumes. We appreciate your
          patience.
        </li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physically able to work?</li>
          <li>Available for work?</li>
          <li>Ready and willing to accept work immediately?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
