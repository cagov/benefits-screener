    1. Look for your EDD Debit Card℠ in the mail
  </h3>
  <p>
    Benefit payments for Unemployment Insurance, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), Disability Insurance, and Paid Family Leave are all made using the EDD Debit Card.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typically, it will take about a week after you certify before you receive your first benefit payment. If you applied for PUA, your EDD Debit Card will be issued within 24-48 hours after you submit your application.
  </p>

    <strong>
      Note:
    </strong>
     Due to the high volume of claims, it may take a few extra days to receive your EDD Debit Card in the mail.

    To continue receiving benefit payments, you’ll need to certify your unemployment status every two weeks via UI Online for the fastest and most secure way to obtain benefits.

    <h4>
      What is certification?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Certification is the required process of updating the EDD every two weeks with your unemployment status with basic eligibility information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Are you physically able to work?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are you available for work?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are you ready and willing to accept work immediately?
      </li>
      <li>
        Did you refuse work?
      </li>
      <li>
        Did you work and earn wages? If so, how much?
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h4>
    All claims from March 29 to July 25, 2020 will include an additional $600 every week
  </h4>
  <p>
    We will automatically add $600 every week certified to eligible claimants from March 29 to July 25, 2020. These funds are part of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (FPUC) program, also referred to as Pandemic Additional Compensation (PAC).
  </p>
  <h4>
    UI benefit payments have been extended for COVID-19 claims
  </h4>
  <p>
    We normally provide up to 26 weeks of UI benefits to eligible claimants. Once we have implemented the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program (PEUC), you may be eligible to extend your benefits for 13 weeks, for a total of 39 weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are still working to implement this program which will take effect retroactively to March 29, 2020. In the interim, individuals who have exhausted their benefits on their regular UI claim may be eligible to receive benefits on a PUA claim.
