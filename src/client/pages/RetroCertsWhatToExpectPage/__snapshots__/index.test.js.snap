        What to expect
      </h2>
      <p>
        We'll ask you about your unemployment status, including the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Were you too sick or injured to work?
        </li>
        <li>
          Was there any reason (other than sickness or injury) that you could not have accepted full-time work each work day?
        </li>
        <li>
          Did you look for work?
        </li>
        <li>
          Did you refuse any work?
        </li>
        <li>
          Did you begin attending any kind of school or training?
        </li>
        <li>
          Did you work or earn money, whether you were paid or not?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You'll need to gather these details about your work, education, and other income for the time period from March 14 to May 9, 2020.
